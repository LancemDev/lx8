# Vim Keybindings & Modal Navigation

lx8 includes an optional Vim modal navigation mode. When enabled, it provides standard modal navigation—Normal mode, Visual mode, and intuitive motions—allowing engineers accustomed to Vim, Neovim, or Helix to navigate documents entirely from the home row.

## Overview & Core Purpose

Many developers maintain decades of muscle memory built around modal text editing. Moving your hand away from the keyboard to grab a mouse or repeatedly pressing arrow keys disrupts cognitive momentum.

lx8's Vim mode brings the speed and ergonomics of modal motions into the code viewer. Because lx8 is focused on code reading and auditing, Vim mode focuses on navigation, scrolling, line jumping, and range selection. When you highlight text in Visual mode, the selection immediately bridges into lx8's context actions—allowing you to press `Alt+C` to copy a reference, `Alt+A` to copy the snippet with its file path and line numbers, or `Alt+U` to find usages.

- **Half-Page & Page Scrolling**:
  - `Ctrl+u`: Scroll half page up.

  - `/`: Start in-file search.
  - `n`: Advance to next search match.
  - `N`: Step backward to previous search match.

### 2. Visual Mode (Selection)
- Press **`v`** to enter character-wise Visual mode.
- Press **`V`** to enter line-wise Visual mode.
- Move the caret using any motion (`j`, `k`, `w`, `$`, etc.) to extend the selection.
- Press **`Esc`** to collapse selection and return to Normal mode.
- While text is selected in Visual mode:
  - `y`: Yank (copy) selected text to clipboard.
  - `Alt+C`: Copy reference pointer (`path#L10-L25`).
  - `Alt+A`: Copy the snippet with its file path and line numbers.

## Enabling Vim Mode

Vim mode can be enabled in Settings:
1. Press **`Cmd/Ctrl+,`** to open Settings.
2. Locate **Editor: Vim Mode** (`editor.vimMode`).
3. Click the `[true]` pill button to activate it immediately.

Alternatively, set `"editor.vimMode": true` in `~/.lx8/settings.json`.

## Status Bar Indicator

When Vim mode is active, the left side of the bottom status bar renders a distinct mode pill:
- `-- NORMAL --`
- `-- VISUAL --`
- `-- VISUAL LINE --`

This provides constant visual feedback of the active modal state.
