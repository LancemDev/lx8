# lx8 Documentation Hub

lx8 is a fast, ultra-light, remote-first code reader and inspection console packaged as a single static binary (~3.5 MB). lx8 starts in under 1 ms, consumes ~20–30 MB of server RAM (~100–180 MB total including the browser tab), and provides instantaneous navigation across repositories containing tens of thousands of files.

This directory houses the comprehensive documentation for lx8, split into user-facing feature guides, internal engineering architecture specifications, and contributor guidelines.
